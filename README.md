# Conway's Game of Life

This is a basic JS implementation of Conway's Game of Life.  It was
intended mainly as a study of the canvas element (as well as the mechanics
of GoL).  I was very pleased with how it came out (though to be fair, I
also wrote it before arrows got fat, so I'm seeing many opportunities for
fewer lines of code).

It would be fun to turn this into a proper node module with tests and such.
We'll see if I can actually find time to do that.

To use:
- Open up index.html in your favorite browser
- Click "cycle"

Have fun!
